<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Simulating a physical phenomena which obeys to known mathematical 
equations is, with a number of approximations, always feasable. But what
 about more abstract concepts, such as feelings, which do not follow any
 laws? The simplest things we can feel are often the hardest things to 
capture in a program. Beat detection follows this rule : feeling the 
beat of a song comes naturally to humans or animals. Indeed it is only a
 feeling one gets when listening to a melody, a feeling which will make 
you dance in rhythm or hit a table with your hands on the melody beats. 
Therefore, how can we teach this beat detection to a machine that can 
only compute logical operations? In fact there are a number of 
algorithms which manage to approximate, more or less accurately, this 
beat detection. We will first study the statistical approach of beat 
detection on a streaming source and secondly a filtering approach of 
rhythm extraction on a static song.</p>
<p>This guide assumes the reader has basic signal processing 
understanding (FFT, convolutions and correlations should sound common) 
maybe some stuff in statistics will also help (Variance, Average, 
Principal Components Analysis, will be quoted among others). The point 
here is not to actually write the code of these algorithms, but more to 
understand how they work and to be able to adapt or create the 
appropriate algorithm to a situation. If you have a question or a 
comment about this text, please send it to the above email address, I'll
 be happy to answer as soon as possible. Anyway, the aim here is to give
 more precise ideas on the subject of beat detection to the reader. 
Enjoy.</p>

<h1>I  Statistical streaming beat detection</h1>
<h2>1  Simple sound energy</h2>
<h3>a - A first analysis</h3>

<p>The human listening system determines the rhythm of music by 
detecting a pseudo  periodical succession of beats. The signal which is
 intercepted by the ear contains a certain energy, this energy is 
converted into an electrical signal which the brain interprets. 
Obviously, The more energy the sound transports, the louder the sound 
will seem. But a sound will be heard as a <b>beat</b> only if his energy is largely superior to the sound's energy history, that is to say if the brain detects a <b>brutal variation in sound energy</b>.
 Therefore if the ear intercepts a monotonous sound with sometimes big 
energy peaks it will detect beats, however, if you play a continuous 
loud sound you will not perceive any beats. Thus, the beats are big 
variations of sound energy. This first analysis will bring us to our 
simplest model : <b><i>Sound energy peaks</i></b>.</p>
<p>In this model we will detect sound energy variations by computing <b>the average sound energy</b> of the signal and comparing it to the <b>instant sound energy</b>.
 Lets say we are working in stereo mode with two lists of values : (an) 
and (bn). (an) contains the list of sound amplitude values captured 
every Te seconds for the left channel, (bn) the list of sound amplitude 
values captured every Te seconds for the right channel. So we want to 
compute the instant energy and the average energy of the signal. The 
instant energy will in fact be the energy contained in 1024 samples 
(1024 values of a[n] and b[n]), 1024 samples represent about 5 hundreds 
of second which is pretty much 'instant'. The average energy should not 
be computed on the entire song, some songs have both intense passages 
and more calm parts. The instant energy must be compared to the nearby 
average energy, for example if a song has an intense ending, the energy 
contained in this ending shouldn't influence the beat detection at the 
beginning. <b>We detect a beat only when the energy is superior to a local energy average.</b>
 Thus we will compute the average energy on say : 44032 samples which is
 about 1 second, that is to say we will assume that the hearing system 
only remembers of 1 second of song to detect beat. This 1 second time 
(44032 samples) is what we could call the human ear energy persistence 
model; it is a compromise between being to big and taking into account 
too far away energies, and being too small and becoming to close to the 
instant energy to make a valuable comparison.</p>
<p>The history buffer where we will keep the last 44032 samples wil 
contain in fact too lists of samples (B[0]) and (B[1]) corresponding to 
the left (an) and to the right (bn) channels history.</p>

<p><b>Simple sound energy algorithm #1:</b></p>
<div class="inlinebox">
<p><b>Every 1024 samples:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the 1024 new samples taken in a[n] and b[n] to compute the 
instant energy 'e', using the following formula (i0 is the position of 
the 1024 samples to process):
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula1.png" alt="" height="64" width="327" border="0">
  <br>(R1)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Compute the local average energy '&lt;E&gt;' on the 44100 samples of a history buffer (B):
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula2.png" alt="" height="52" width="356" border="0">
  <br>(R2)</p>
  </li><li>Shift the 44032 history buffer (B) of 1024 indexes to the 
right so that we make room for the 1024 new samples and evacuate the 
oldest 1024 samples.</li>
  <li>Move the 1024 new samples on top of the history buffer.</li>
  <li>Compare 'e' to 'C * &lt;E&gt;' where C is a constant which will 
determine the sensibility of the algorithm to beats. A good value for 
this constant is 1.3. If 'e' is superior to 'C * &lt;E&gt;' then we have
 a beat!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>b - Some direct optimisations</h3>
<p>This was the basic version of the algorithm, its speed and accurecy 
can be improved quite easily. The algorithm can be optimised by <b>keeping the energy values computed on 1024 samples in history instead of the samples themselves</b>,
 so that we don't have to compute the average energy on the 44100 
samples buffer (B) but on the instant energies history we will call (E).
 This sound energy history buffer (E) <b>must</b> correspond to approximately <b>1 second of music</b>,
 that is to say it must contain the energy history of 44032 samples 
(calculated on groups of 1024) if the sample rate is 44100 samples per 
second. Thus E[0] will contain the newest energy computed on the newest 
1024 samples, and E[42] will contain the oldest energy computed on the 
oldest 1024 samples. We have 43 energy values in history, each computed 
on 1024 samples which makes 44032 samples energy history, which is 
equivalent to 1 second in real time. The count is good. The value of 1 
second represents the persistance of the music energy in the human ear, 
it was obtain with experimentations but it may varry a little from a 
person to another, just adjust it as you feal. So here is what the 
algorithm becomes:</p>

<p><b>Simple sound energy algorithm #2:</b></p>
<div class="inlinebox">
<p><b>Every 1024 samples:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Compute the instant sound energy 'e' on the 1024 new sample values taken in (an) and (bn) using the formula <b>(R1)</b></li>
  <li>Compute the average local energy &lt;E&gt; with (E) sound energy history buffer:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula3.png" alt="" height="53" width="173" border="0">
  <br>(R3)</p>
  </li><li>Shift the sound energy history buffer (E) of 1 index to the right. We make room for the new energy value and flush the oldest.</li>
  <li>Pile in the new energy value 'e' at E[0].</li>
  <li>Compare 'e' to 'C*&lt;E&gt;'.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>c - Sensitivity detection</h3>
<p>The imediate draw back of this algorithm is <b>the choice of the 'C' constant</b>.
 For example in techno and rap music beats are quite intense and precise
 so 'C' should be quite high (about 1.4); whereas for rock and roll, or 
hard rock which contains a lot of noise, the beats are more confused and
 'C' should be low (about 1.1 or 1.0). There is a way, to make the 
algorithm determine automatically the good choice for the 'C' constant. 
We must compute <b>the variance of the energies</b> contained in the 
energy history buffer (E). This variance, which is nothing but the 
average of ( Energy Values  Energy average = (E) - &lt;E&gt; ), will 
quantify how marked the beats of the song are and thus will give us a 
way to compute the value of the 'C' constant. The formula to calculate 
the variance of the 43 E[i] values is described below <b>(R4)</b>. 
Finally, the greater the variance is the more sensitive the algorithm 
should be and thus the smaller 'C' will become. We can choose a linear 
decrease of 'C' with 'V' (the variance) and for example when V &#8594; 200, C &#8594;
 1.0 and when V &#8594; 25, C &#8594; 1.45 <b>(R5)</b>. This is our new version of the sound energy beat detection algorithm:</p>

<p><b>Simple sound energy algorithm #3:</b></p>
<div class="inlinebox">
<p><b>Every 1024 samples:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Compute the instant sound energy 'e' on the 1024 new samples taken in (an) and (bn) using the following formula <b>(R1)</b>.</li>
  <li>Compute the average local energy &lt;E&gt; with (E) sound energy history buffer using formula <b>(R3)</b>.</li>
  <li>Compute the variance 'V' of the energies in (E) using the following formula:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula4.png" alt="" height="56" width="231" border="0">
  <br>(R4)</p></li>
  <li>Compute the 'C' constant using a linear degression of 'C' with 'V', using a linear regression with values <b>(R5)</b>:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula5.png" alt="" height="24" width="263" border="0">
  <br>(R6)</p></li>

<p>Those three algorithms were tested with several types of music, among
 others : pop, rock, metal, techno, rap, classical, punk. The fact is 
the results are quite unpredictable. I will only talk about <i>Simple beat detection algorithm #3</i> as <i>#2</i> and <i>#1</i> are only pedagogical intermediates to get to the <i>#3</i>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <b>the beat detection is very accurate and sounds right with techno and rap</b>,
 the beats are very precise and the music contains very few noise. The 
algorithm is quite satisfying for that kind of music and if you aim to 
use beat detection on techno you can stop reading here, the rest won't 
change anything to your beat detection. However, even if the improvement
 of the dynamic 'C' calculations ameliorates things alot, <b>the beat detection on punk, rock and hard rock, is sometimes quite approximate</b>.
 We can feel it doesn't really get the rythm of the song. Indeed the 
algorithm detects energy peaks. Sometimes you can hear a drum beat which
 is sank among other noises and which goes trough the algorithm without 
being detected as a beat. </p>
<p>To explain this phenomena lets say a guitare and flute make 
alternatively an amplitude constant note. Each time the first finishes 
the other starts. The note made by the guitare and the note made by the 
flute have the same energy but the ear detects a certain rhythm because 
the notes of the instruments are at different pitch. For our algorithm 
(who is one might say colorblind) it is just an amplitude constant noise
 with no energy peaks. This partly explains why the algorithm doesn't 
detect precisely beats in songs with a lot of instruments playing at 
different rythms and simultaneously. Our next analysis will make us walk
 through this difficulty.</p>
<p>Comparing the results we have obtained with the <i>Simple beat detection algorithm #3</i>
 to its computing cost, this algorithm is very efficient. If you are not
 looking for a perfect beat detection than I recommend you use it. Here 
is a screenshot of a program I made using this algorithm. You fill find 
the binaries and the sources on my homepage.</p>

<h2>2  Frequency selected sound energy</h2>
<h3>a - The idea and the algorithm</h3>
<p>The issue with our last analysis of beat detection is that it is 
colorblind. We have seen that this could raise quite a few problems for 
noisy like songs in rock or pop music. What we must do is give our 
algorithm the abbility to determine on which frequency subband we have a
 beat and if it is powerful enough to take it into account. Basically we
 will try to detect <b>big sound energy variations in particular frequency subbands</b>,
 just like in our last analysis; unless this time we will be able to 
seperate beats regarding their color ( frequency subband ). Thus If we 
want to give more importants to low frequency beats or to high frequency
 beats it should be more easy. Notice that the energy computed in the 
time domain is the same as the energy computed in the frequency domain, 
so we don't have any difference between computing the energy in time 
domain or in frequency domain. For maths freaks this is called the 
Parseval Theorem.</p>
<p>Okay that was just a bit of sport, lets go back to the mainstream; Here is how the <b><i>Frequency selected sound energy</i></b>
 algorithm works: The source signals are still coming from (an) and 
(bn). (an) and (bn) can be taken from a wave file, or directly from a 
streaming microphon or line input. Each time we have accumulated 1024 
new samples, we will pass to the frequency domain with a <b>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</b>.
 We will thus obtain a 1024 frequency spectrum. We then divide this 
spectrum into however many subbands we like, here I will take 32. The 
more subbands you have, the more sensitive the algorithm will be but the
 harder it will become to adapt it to lots of different kinds of songs. 
Then we compute the <b>sound energy</b> contained in <b>each of the subbands</b> and we compare it to the<b> recent energy average corresponding to this subband</b>. If one or more subbands have an energy superior to their average we have detected a beat.</p>
<p>The great progress with the last algorithm is that we now know more 
about our beats, and thus we can use this information to change an 
animation, for example. So here is more precisely the <i>Frequency selected sound energy algorithm #1:</i></p>

<p><b>Frequency selected sound energy algorithm #1:</b></p>
<div class="inlinebox">
<p><b>Every 1024 samples:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Compute the FFT on the 1024 new samples taken in (an) and (bn). 
The FFT inputs a complex numeric signal. We will say (an) is the real 
part of the signal and (bn) the imagenary part. Thus the FFT will be 
made on the 1024 complex values of:
  <p align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula6.png" alt="" height="31" width="109" border="0"></p>
  <p><i>You can find FFT tutorials and codes in C, Visual Basic or C++ on my homepage in the 'tutorials' section or by typing 'FFT' on <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.</i></p>
  </li>
  <li>From the FFT we obtain 1024 complex numbers. We compute the square
 of their module and store it into a new 1024 buffer. This buffer (B) 
contains the 1024 frequency amplitudes of our signal.<br><br></li>
  <li>Divide the buffer into 32 subbands, compute the energy on each of 
these subbands and store it at (Es). Thus (Es) will be 32 sized and 
Es[i] will contain the energy of subband 'i':
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula7.png" alt="" height="61" width="248" border="0">
  <br>(R7)</p></li>
  <li>Now, to each subband 'i' corresponds an energy history buffer 
called (Ei). This buffer contains the last 43 energy computations for 
the 'i' subband. We compute the average energy &lt;Ei&gt; for the 'i' 
subband simply by using:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula8.png" alt="" height="60" width="205" border="0">
  <br>(R8)</p></li>
  <li>Shift the sound energy history buffers (Ei) of 1 index to the 
right. We make room for the new energy value of the subband 'i' and 
flush the oldest.<br><br></li>
  <li>Pile in the new energy value of subband 'i' : Es[i] at Ei[0].
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula9.png" alt="" height="33" width="129" border="0">
  <br>(R9)</p></li>
  <li>For each subband 'i' if Es[i] &gt; (C*&lt;Ei&gt;) we have a beat !</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>To help out visualising how the data piles work have a look at this scheme:</p>
<p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/image032.png" alt="" height="392" width="721" border="0">
<br>Figure 2: This is how the energy data is organized.</p>

<p>Now the 'C' constant of this algorithm has nothing to do with the 'C'
 of the first algorithm, because we deal here with separated subbands 
the energy varies globally much more than with colorblind algorithms. 
Thus 'C' must be about 250. The results of this algorithm are 
convincing, it detects for example a symbal rhythm among other heavy 
noises in metal rock, and indeed the algorithm separates the signal into
 subbands, therefore the <b>symbal rhythm cannot pass trough the 
algorithm without being recognized because it is isolated in the 
frequency domain from other sounds. </b>However the complexity of the algorithm makes it useful only if you are dealing with very noisy sounds, in other cases, <i>Simple beat detection algorithm #3</i> will do the job.</p>

<h3>b - Enhancements and beat decision factors.</h3>
<p>There are ways to enhance a bit more our <i>Frequency selected sound energy algorithm #1</i>.</p>
<p>First we will increase the <b>number of subbands from 32 to 64</b>. 
This will take obviously more computing time but it will also give us 
more precision in our beat detection. The second way to develop the 
accuracy of the algorithm uses the defaults of human ears. Human hearing
 system is not perfect; in fact its transfer function is more like a low
 pass filter. We hear more easily and more clearly low pitched noises 
than high pitch noises. This is why it is preferable to make a 
logarithmic repartition of the subbands. That is to say that subband 0 
will contain only say 2 frequencies whereas the last subband, will 
contain say 20. <b>More precisely the width 'wi' of the 'n' subbands indexed 'i' can be obtained using this argument:</b></p>

<p></p><div class="inlinebox">
<ul>
  <li>Linear increase of the width of the subband with its index:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula10.png" alt="" height="25" width="123" border="0">
  <br>(R10)</p></li>
  <li>We can choose for example the width of the first subband:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula11.png" alt="" height="25" width="97" border="0">
  <br>(R11)</p></li>
  <li>The sum of all the widths must not exceed 1024 ((B)'s size):
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula12.png" alt="" height="60" width="503" border="0">
  <br>(R12)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Once you have equations <b>(R11)</b> and <b>(R12)</b> it is fairly 
easy to extract 'a' and 'b', and thus to find the law of the 'wi'. This 
calculus of 'a' and 'b' must be made manually and 'a' and 'b' defined as
 constants in the source; indeed they do not vary during the song. </p>
<p>So in fact in <i>Frequency selected sound energy algorithm #1</i>, all we have to modify is the number of subbands we will take equal to 64 and the <b>(R7)</b> relation. This relation becomes:</p>
<p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/forumla7-2.png" alt="" height="137" width="312" border="0">
<br>(R7)'</p>
<p>It may seem rather complicated but in fact it is not. Replacing this relation <b>(R7)</b> with <b>(R7)'</b> we have created <i>Frequency selected sound energy algorithm #2.</i>
 If you have musics with very tight and rapid beats, you may want to 
compute the stuff more frequently than every 1024 samples, but this is 
only for special cases, normally the beat should not be shorter than 
1/40 of second.</p>
<p>Using the advantages of Frequency selected beat detection you can 
also enhance the beat decision factor. Up to now it was based on a 
simple comparison between the instant energy of the subband and the 
average energy of the subband. This algorithm enables you to decide 
beats differently. You may want for examples to cut beats which 
correspond to high pitch sounds if you run techno music or you may want 
to keep only [50-4000Hz] beats if you are working with speech signal. 
This algorithm has the advantage of being perfectly adaptable to any 
kind or category of signal which was not the case of <i>Simple beat detection algorithm #3</i>. Notice that the correspondants between index 'i' of the FFT transform and real frequency is given by formula :</p>

<p></p><div class="inlinebox">
<ul>
  <li>If 'i' &lt; 'N/2' then:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula13.png" alt="" height="53" width="96" border="0">
  <br>(R13)</p></li>
  <li>Else 'i' &gt;= 'N/2' then:
  <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula14.png" alt="" height="53" width="153" border="0">
  <br>(R14)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>So 'i' is the index of the value in the FFT output buffer, N is the 
size of the FFT transform (here 1024), fe is the sample frequency (here 
44100). Thus index 256 corresponds to 10025 Hz. This formula may be 
useful if you want to create your own subbands and you want to know what
 the correspondants <b>between indexes and real frequency</b> are.</p>
<p>Another way of filtering the beats, or selecting them, is choosing 
only those which are marked and precise enough. As we have seen before, <b>to detect the accuracy of beats we must compute the variance of the energy histories for each subband</b>.
 If this variance is high it means that we have great differences of 
energy and thus that the beat are very intense. Thus all we have to do 
is compute this variance for each subband and add a test in the beat 
detection decision. To the "Es[i] &gt; (C*&lt;Ei&gt;)" condition we will
 add "and V((Ei))&gt;V0". V0 will be the variance limit, with experience
 150 is a reasonable value. Now the V((Ei)) value is easy to compute, 
just follow the following equality if you don't see how :</p>
<p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/formula15.png" alt="" height="60" width="323" border="0">
<br>(R15)</p>
<p>The last (finally) way to enhance your beat detection, is to make the source signal pass through a <b>derivation filter. </b>Indeed
 differentiating the signal makes big variations of amplitude more 
marked and thus makes energy variations more marked and recognisable 
later in the algorithm. I haven't tried this optimisation but according 
to some sources this is quite useful. If you try it please give me your 
opinion on it!</p>
<p>Concerning the results of the <i>Frequency selected sound energy algorithm #2</i> I must admit they are way more satisfying than the <i>Simple sound energy algorithm #3</i>.
 In a song the algorithm catches the bass beats as well as the tight 
cymbals hits. I insist on the fact that you may also select the beats in
 very different ways, which becomes quite useful if you know you are 
going to run techno music with low pitch beats for example. You may also
 select the beats differently according to there accuracy with the 
variance criteria. There are many other ways to decide beats; it is up 
to you to explore them and find the one which fits the most your needs.</p>
<p>I used <i>Frequency selected sound energy algorithm #2</i>algorithm 
in a demo program of which you can see some screenchots just below. One 
can see quite clearly that there is a beat in low frequencies (probably a
 bass or drum hit) and also a high pitch beat (probably a cymbal or 
such):</p>
<p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/image052.png" alt="" height="604" width="804" border="0">
<br>Figure 3: The histogram represents the instant energy of the 128 subbands.</p>
<p class="caption" align="center"><img src="GameDev.net%20--%20Beat%20Detection%20Algorithms_files/image054.png" alt="" height="602" width="803" border="0">
<br>Figure 4: On this screenshot you can see the 128 subbands 
E/&lt;E&gt; ratios, and the bandwidth of the subbands. When the 
algorithm detects a beat in a subband, it overwrites the ratio in red.</p>
<p>The reason why I called this part of the document, 'Statistical 
streaming beat detection', is that the energy can be considered as a 
random variable, of which we have been calculating values over time. 
Thus we could interpret those values as a sampling for the statistical 
analysis of a random variable. But one can push this approach further. 
When we have separated the energies histories into 128 subbands we 
created in fact 128 random energy variables. We can then apply some of 
the general statistical methods of analysis. For example, the principal 
components analysis method will enable you to determine if some of the 
subbands are directly linked or independent. This would help us to 
regroup some subbands which are directly linked and thus make the beat 
decision more efficient. However, this method is basically just far too 
computing expensive and maybe just too hard to implement comparing to 
the results we want. If you are looking for a really good challenge in 
beat detection you could push in this direction.</p>
